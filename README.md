# Anomaly-Detection-Using-ML
Implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect anomalies using Character Font Images Dataset

This project is submitted to a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/bt4012-in-class-kaggle-competition-2021-october/overview for BT4012 Fraud Analytics In-class Kaggle Competition. 
In this project, I implemented machine learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect anomalies in the Character Font Images Dataset.
